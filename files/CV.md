### Work Experience ‚Äì Behavox
*Behavox is a security software company specialising in communication surveillance. Leading AI compliance solution in the marketplace.*

#### Data Science Production Team Lead <span style="float: right">2024‚Äìpresent</span>
- Leading development and deployment of multilingual NLP applications
- Executing cross-team roadmapping for ML features under real-world production constraints
- Building reusable tooling enabling rapid MVPs for client deployments and proofs of concept

#### Insider Crime Product Lead <span style="float: right">2020‚Äì2024</span>
- Led R&D and production of high-precision (81% at 0.5% FPR) misconduct detection systems using RoBERTa + SBERT models architecture pipeline
- Specialised in working with Large Language Models (LLM), fine-tuning them to meet Insider Crime product requirements
- Validated and proved that shorter text sequences in RoBERTa training maintain performance, doubling training speed and halving company training costs
- Developed and maintained cloud-based infrastructures using AWS, Docker + Slack API
- Maintained model performance through continuous training, synthetic data QA, and AWS S3 workflows
- Developed a hybrid recommendation system leveraging RoBERTa and SBERT for text embeddings, K-Means for clustering, and integrated user attributes into a CatBoost model for personalised predictions

#### Data Scientist <span style="float: right">2017‚Äì2020</span>
*Key responsibilities:* development of multilingual applications and reports to flag statistical deviations and compliance breaches in client data, designing and building infrastructure to support application creation, QA and maintenance
- Landed proof of concepts that resulted in 3+ years client contracts
- Improved compliance model recalls from 70% to 90%
- Reduced client bug requests from 1/day to 1/month by setting up an efficient QA process
- Self-studied Java to remove the Analytics dependency on Backend teams
- Developed best practices for code quality as one of the first Data Science hires and created foundational documentation during company scaling
